# **The BoringApp**


## Description

This project has for purpose to challenge our skills with the latest knowledge in Javascript, HTML and CSS using different server API's by creating a **real-world** front-end application with the idea to potentially showcase it to future employers. 

## Objectives

```md 
The main objective of this project is to create an application that could be related to our daily lifes. And since 2 years our daily lives have been more online then ever. Which is factor of daily boredom. Thus the idea to help those people who are in need of a boredom cure.
The BoringApp team made an easy to understand application that will permit the user to cure boredom by entertaining them. 
With the hope to give a productivity boost at the end of the break. 
```
## Functionality

In order to prevent and control boredom during working breaks, we - Niko de Silva, Zahra Mammadli, Nabil Nasser and Olivier R.Measson - have been working on developing an interactive front-end application that has for purpose to "cure" your boredom. 
The application permits for a user to "make a choice" between watching random videos using the **youtube API** or to learn something using the **bored API**. 

This project permitted us to learn how to work as a team.
Using Github, we've been able to succesfully separate equally the tasks and maintain a proper workflow to achieve our goals. 
We learned how to create different branches and how (and also when) to merge them. 
We also learned how to apply different server-side API's in our application. 

## Usage
```md
WHEN the user opens the BoringApp
THEN he is presented with the main page (inspired by Alice in Wonderland) where there is one button that will grab the attention and where he can access information such as: About us - Stats & Contacts
```
![Welcome Page](screenshots/welcome-page.png) 

```md
WHEN the user clicks this button
THEN they will access to the next page where the user will face a choice between two pills: a blue pill and a red pill (inspired by the matrix)
```
![Pills: Make a choice](screenshots/make-a-choice.png) 

```md
WHEN the user hovers his mouse over one of the pills
THEN text appears to inform the user about his choice possibility
```

![Red Pill](screenshots/red_pill.png)

```md
WHEN the user clicks on the BLUE pill 
THEN the user will access a page where he will have the choice to make an activity (based on the Bored server API) or to watch someone do it online ( by pushing the bored activity into the youtube search query)
```
![Random Activity](screenshots/click-bluel.png) 
```md
WHEN the user clicks on the RED pill
THEN he will stay in the matrix and be directed to a page where he can watch random videos (Youtube API)
```
![Random Video](screenshots/click-red.png) 
```md
WHEN the user wants to know who the creators are
THEN he will find a "About Us" button in the navbar
WHEN the user access this page
THEN he will be presented with the following information
```
![About Us](screenshots/about-us.png)

```md
WHEN the user wants to know what the global percentage of choice for the pills is
THEN he will find the "Statistics" button in the navbar
WHEN the user access this page
THEN he will find a graph with the necessary information (by retrieving stats from the local storage and building it with d3.js)
```
![Statistics](screenshots/statistics.png)

```md
WHEN the user wants to contact the creators
THEN he will find the "Contact US" button in the navbar
WHEN the user access this page
THEN he will be presented with a Contact Form and the email address of the creators
```
