          If I die, just know it was of boredom not the Covid
        </h5>
        We come close to the end of 2021 still in the midst of a pandemic: still
        social distancing, still self-isolating, still wearing masks, still
        feeling as if life is on pause. These restrictions, as necessary as they
        are, mean that most of us are living in a limited environment with
        limited activities to occupy ourselves, to satisfy our need for
        meaningful experiences.During the pandemic “boredom” has become a code
        word for any experience in which people feel disconnected, when life
        appears meaningless or uninteresting. but sometimes one word, one
        randomly watched video, one exercise draws our attention so much that we
        forget about boredom for a long period of time. We find joy, we learn,
        we make decisions and sometime this lead to tremendous changes in life.
        We want to take you out of the routine of your daily life and show you
        how deep the rabbit hole is. Come with us to Wonderland!
